  <h1>Applied Physics Engineering</h1>

  <p>Welcome to our website!</p>

  <p><b>Reasons for being.</b> We have two reasons for setting up this site: we want to let you know that we have a
    patent that you might be interested in; and we want to share some interesting projects with you.</p>

  <p><b>Technical blog.</b> You might say that this is a technical blog. My personal life isn't all that interesting,
    but the projects may be.</p>

  <p><b>Smooth computer sketching.</b> <img src="images/heart.jpg" align="right" width="61" height="68" border="0"
      alt="Example of a heart" border="0" style="margin-left: 8px"> The first project is a much better way to sketch on
    a computer using a mouse or a trackball. To learn more about this method and download a small demo program, <a
      href="sketch.html" title="Get a download">click</a> here.</p>

  <br clear="all">

  <p><b>Multi-motion swing.</b> <a href="index.html" onload="document.swing.src= swingblank.src"><img
        src="gif/blankswing.gif" align="right" width="152" height="166" name="swing" alt="Blank swing area" border="0"
        style="margin-left: 8px">(mouse over the links below)</a> The second project is one that I have no vested interest in, but I've had fun
    playing with. Which would be more interesting, a standard playground <a href="index.html"
      onmouseover="document.swing.src= swingnormal.src" onmouseout="document.swing.src=swingblank.src">swing</a> or one
    that'll do <a href="index.html" onmouseover="document.swing.src= swingmm.src"
      onmouseout="document.swing.src= swingblank.src">this</a>? For more details on this   <a
      href="multimotionswing.html" title="More details">unusual backyard swing, click here</a>.</p>

  <br clear="all">

  <p><b>Bounceless stop.</b>The third project is one that I had a vested interest in (my second patent). I have since
    let that patent lapse because I couldn't justify paying the fairly-high patent maintenance fees. Let me demonstrate
    the basic idea involved by showing a video (the one on the left) of a very bouncy rubber ball dropping onto a
    concrete floor. Compare this with a similar video (the one on the right) of the same ball dropping onto a thin flat
    plate with radial slits, per my patent. Quite a difference, isn't there? For more on this curious subject, <a
      href="bouncelessstop.html" title="How to stop a bouncy ball from bouncing">click</a> here.

    <p>Note that Apple's Quicktime 7 is needed in order to watch the videos. It is a free program from Apple and works
      in both Mac and Windows. <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime">www.apple.com/quicktime</a></p>

    <p><b>Kakuro hints.</b> I have added a <a href="kakurohints.html" title="Hints on solving Kakuro puzzles">page</a>
      of hints on working Kakuro (cross sums) puzzles. My daughter sent me a book of the puzzles and gave me a hint on
      working them. </p>

    <p><b>Who determines the sex of the child?</b> When I Google&trade; the question: "Who determines the sex of the
      child?" the answers mainly assure me that the father does, because only the sperm can contain a Y chromosome, not
      the egg. It seems to me that getting from the simple biological fact (only the sperm can contain a Y chromosome)
      to the conclusion (the father determines the sex of the child) requires an unstated assumption; that the egg
      can't, or won't, select a given sperm. If the egg can actively select among the numerous available sperm cells,
      then a given egg may be pre-programmed to allow only a male-producing or only a female-producing sperm. This idea
      came as a way to explain an <a href="pdf/bgtwins.pdf"
        title="PDF showing an interesting pattern of boy-girl twins">interesting genetic tree</a> from a family I am
      aware of. Of the six sets of boy-girl twins shown, all six have a mother on the genetic tree, not a father. Either
      this pattern is just a statistical fluke, or a gene programs the mothers involved to release a boy-preferring egg
      and a girl-preferring egg at the same time.

      <p>The answer to this question may not be so much a question of genetics, but of biology. Have any studies shown
        that the human egg is not capable of selelecting sperm? My degrees are in engineering, not in genetics or
        biology, so I certainly don't know, but I'm also not real sure that those who answer the question when I
        Google&trade; know either.</p>

      <p>I have tried at least four versions of this question (using the quotation marks) and get a fairly narrow range
        of number of hits: "Who determines the sex of the child?" (29,200); "Who determines the sex of a child?"
        (16,200); "Who determines the sex of the baby?" (36,400);"Who determines the sex of a baby?" (20,900). Without
        the quotation marks the results are in the millions.</p>

      There are a number of people who could be on this genetic tree, but I just don't have the details I would need to
      show them. I have found out that the pattern extends into Norway, where the initial person in the chart came from.
      (She had siblings who were boy-girl twins). There is also at least one more set of boy-girl twins on this tree,
      but I don't have the details yet. It would be easy for an investigator to fill in the missing branches of the tree
      to see if the pattern persists. If it does, it would be a strong indicator that there is a genetic component
      involved. In that case a DNA analysis might be warranted. I'm sure that at least some of the people charted would
      be willing to cooperate in a DNA analysis. I wonder why such a basic question of our human existence hasn't been
      thoroughly researched. Maybe it has and I'm just not aware of it.
