  <p>My physics books of about fifty years ago call this a "double pendulum," but that term now seems to refer to a
    pendulum on the end of a pendulum, so I'll just call it a "multi-motion swing."</p>

  <p>This swing is similar to the common tire-on-the-end-of-a-rope, but uses a Y-shaped rope arrangement, like this:</p>

  <p> <img src="webswingsupport.gif" align="right" width="127" height="109" border="0" style="margin-left: 8px"
      alt="Swing support arrangement."></p>

  <p>Because of the Y-shaped support ropes, the swing takes less time to go left-to-right-to-left than to go
    back-to-front-to-back. If you divide the longer time period by the shorter time period, this ratio has a very big
    effect on what motions you can get. The period for each direction depends only on the square root of the length of
    the pendulum for that direction (and on the acceleration of gravity, but that's pretty constant on the surface of
    the earth).</p>

  <p>The motion shown in the animated GIF is based on an overall length of 56 inches from the top supports to the weight
    and 28.57 inches for the vertical string. The ratio of the higher to the lower frequency is the square root of 56
    over 28.57, or 7/5, or 1.4. As we look down on the swing, it makes 7 cycles going left to right to left while it is
    making 5 cycles going top to bottom to top. Different Web browsers handle animated GIFs differently, so the speed of
    the motion may not look right. The period (time to complete one cycle) in the vertical direction should be 2.4
    seconds and 1.714 seconds horizontally.</p>

  <p>The motion you actually get also depends on the starting position of the swing. You get the dullest motions by
    starting from left, right, back, or front. You get the more interesting motions by starting at some off angle, like
    two steps back and two steps to the right. If the ratio of the periods is equal to the ratio of two relatively small
    whole numbers, the motion will repeat itself in just a few cycles. Otherwise, it may never repeat itself. For one
    thing, a child is definitely <b>not</b> a compact rigid body, so you can only get an approximate location for the
    center of gravity and it will keep shifting while the child is swinging.</p>

  <p>That leads up to a vital question: How can you <q>pump up</q> an unusual swing like this? As near as I can tell,
    the answer was given to me by a fellow engineer when he told me that he pumped up a slowly-moving swing just by
    standing on the seat with his knees bent, then standing up at the bottom of the arc. Each time he got to the high
    point, he'd crouch down again. Remembering that I always sat on the swing and leaned way back at the low point and
    sat up straight at the high point, I wasn't at all sure that the bending-knees method would work. In addition to
    trying it, I analyzed it and concluded that he was right. In fact, I couldn't think of any other way than to force
    my center of gravity up when the swing had the most centrifugal force (the most tension in the support ropes) and
    let it drop when the swing had the least tension in the ropes. (Thanks, Ed.)</p>

  <p>The same idea should apply to this unusual backyard swing. In the animation of a multi-motion swing we designed it
    so the swing would have one or more places where the swing temporarily stopped, so a swinger could crouch down, and
    one or more other places where the swing was moving the fastest (hanging straight down), so a swinger could stand up
    straight.</p>

  <p>I intended to set up this kind of a swing in our basement so I, or my kids, or my grandkids could try it out. I
    pretty much gave up on that idea for several reasons. First and foremost, the Y-shaped arrangement shown above is
    <b>unsafe</b>. Depending on the included angle between the upper two supports, the tension in them can be much
    greater than the weight of the swinger. At the very least, the vertical chain should reach all the way up, to be in
    line with the tops of the other two. This wouldn't affect the motions of the swing. I say "chain", because a steel
    chain would be a lot safer than a rope. Steel is a good, dependable structural material. Rope materials really
    aren't.</p>

  <p>Secondly, we are used to swings which have about six-foot-long chains, giving periods of about 2.7 seconds, so I'd
    like the vertical chain to be about that long. The overall distance from the top supports to the seat, or platform
    if we intend to stand, would be about twice as long, about 12 feet. I don't have that much height in my basement. I
    also don't have three large trees in our back yard to use. For someone with trees appropriately situated or the time
    and energy to build a large support frame, this might be a nice do-it-yourself project. I don't know of any
    commercial versions of this swing, but there may be some out there.</p>

  <p>As a do-it-yourself project, I tried to modify a broken radio-controlled car so I could use it as the swinging
    weight and remotely raise and lower it to pump up the swing. I imagined a bit of a family competition to see who
    could pump it up the most and the fastest. If the design or the construction weren't quite structurally adequate, we
    just lose a toy, not a family member. This idea didn't work very well, as the weight couldn't move up or down fast
    enough. A linear solenoid might work, but I don't have one. I did try a couple of other ways of moving the weight up
    and down and convinced myself that you really can <q>pump up</q> this kind of swing. I also built a version as a
    swing for a small doll. In this case, the child just pushes on the doll.</p>
