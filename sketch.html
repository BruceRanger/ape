      alt="Example of a heart">The picture on the right will give you an idea of what you could do very easily,
    <b>if</b> this drawing method were available in a drawing or paint application. The right side was sketched by
    defining just three points and an angle at one of the points. A simple flip gives the left side.</p>

  <p>To use a computer to sketch a smooth heart and color it in, you would need an application with a drawing method
    built into it that would let you very simply draw smooth curves. That's what I tried to do some years ago so I could
    send Valentine's cards to my grandkids. I tried ClarisWorks because that came with the Mac I was using. The result
    was not pretty. The freehand drawing tool made very jagged lines that I couldn't smooth out. The Bezier tool made
    smooth curves, but I couldn't figure out how to make the lines go where I wanted them to. When I got a later Mac
    with AppleWorks, it was no better. I needed a sketching tool that an amateur could use, so I invented one and got a
    patent on it (Patent No.: <b>US 6,441,822</b>). You can <a
      href="http://patimg1.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=06441822&idkey=NONE" title="Drawing Patent">see</a> the actual patent.
    If your web browser has trouble displaying the patent, you can look at this <a href="pdf/adpatpdf.pdf"
      title="PDF of patent">PDF</a> version.</p>

  <p>I thought that Apple would jump at the chance to build this drawing method into AppleWorks, but they weren't
    interested. They also have a very firm rule against considering any non-solicited suggestions. Of course, my letter
    to Steve Jobs himself went unanswered.</p>

  <p>When my wife got a computer (built by one of my sons and me) that ran Windows XP, I tried out their built-in paint
    program. The drawing tools worked very much like Apple's, not well at all. Someone at Microsoft must have read my
    letter to Mr. William H. Gates, because I was contacted by their Partner group. They evaluated my demo program and
    decided that what they had was plenty good enough for their customers. Besides, there were a lot of graphics
    applications on the market for those who needed better.</p>

  <p>One application on the market that would seem to be a good fit with this drawing method is Print Shop because it
    seems to be slanted towards amateur users. The Windows version has a freehand drawing tool no better than Apple's or
    Microsoft's. They took care of that in the Mac version: they didn't include such a tool at all.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, this sketching method isn't available except as a demo program. The drawing method could be designed
    to work with any operating system, but I have no intention of developing and marketing such a package. If you would
    like to try out the demo try <a href="sketchingdemo.html" title="Download a small demo program">one of these</a>
    downloads. One of the versions should work on most Macs, even the newer ones that use Intel chips, or in Windows XP.
  </p>

  <p>The demo can be freely passed around. In fact, that's what I'm hoping for. Since I haven't had any luck getting any
    of the software companies to seriously consider licensing this drawing method, I'm hoping for a little reaction from
    the amateurs that would like to do some original drawings on their computers.</p>

  <p>One problem with putting the demo on this Web site is your possible concern that it might contain a virus or some
    other nasty critter. All I can say is that I wouldn't do something stupid like that when I'm trying to get people
    interested in my patent.</p>

  <p>You will need a good imagination to see how this drawing method would be a good thing to have available, but it's
    one of those things that you'll probably never get if you don't ask for it. Good luck to both of us!</p>
